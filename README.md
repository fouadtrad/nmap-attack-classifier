# Detecting and Classifying NMAP Scans with ML techniques

In this project, we implement an NMAP-attack live detection system, powered by a FCNN detector and a Random Forest classifier. This project is part of the EECE655 course offered at American University of Beirut.

## Install guide
1. First, you will need to install the **kdd99_feature_extractor** tool by following the instructions [here](kdd99_feature_extractor)
2. Next, clone the project into a directory of your choice `<path-to-project>` and navigate to it
3. Execute `bash install.sh`

## Running the tool
1. Navigate to the directory containing the tool (default is `~/kdd99_feature_extraction`).
2. Execute `bash run-detect.sh`

## Training the models
Refer to `classifier/README.md`
